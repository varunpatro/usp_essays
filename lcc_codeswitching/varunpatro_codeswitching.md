Code-switching or the alternating use of more than one language during a single conversation has been well studied since the 1940s [@auer2013code]. In this paper, I will examine the code-switching practices of four Hindi-English bilinguals to better understand the socio-cognitive purposes it serves them. As my analysis will later reveal, I argue that code-switching allows the interlocutors to (a) set the mood and alter the seriousness of the conversation and (b) imbue traits of another character onto themselves to effectively communicate an attitude.

## Summary of the data analyzed

For this investigation, I recorded an informal conversation among four of my Hindi-English bilingual friends. My friends grew up in various parts of north India and currently study in NUS, Singapore. The five-minute conversation I recorded occurs in the dormitory room of a friend after dinner. In this casual conversation, my friends discuss their weekend plans. Specifically, they discuss their attendance to two birthday celebrations taking place on the coming Saturday.

Let me quickly summarize the code-switching patterns I observed to set the context for further analysis. Discounting code-switching for lexical gaps and language borrowings such as the use of English words *fake*, *weekend* and *analyze* while speaking Hindi, here are the results:

1. 81 sentences spoken
2. 34 in Hindi
3. 32 in English
4. 15 in a mix of both

Further analysis on each interlocutor reveals that each of them code-switch heavily. Utkarsh, Gulati, Priyanka, and Mudit speak exclusively in English only 40%, 28%, 13%, 52% of the time respectively.

This preliminary analysis suggests that language norm of the setting is a blend of Hindi and English. Although the norm of the whole conversation is a blend. I will argue shortly that their code-switching between the two is highly meaningful. For example, I observe that gossiping about people primarily take place in Hindi while argumentation and speaking factual truths occur in English. I analyze the significance of code-switching in the next three sections.

## Use of English for argumentation and serious conversations

An important observation I identified is that English is primarily used for argumentation. Its use connotes a greater gravity and seriousness in the conversation. For example, when it became clear that most people were unable to attend Shailesh's (a friend absent from this conversation) birthday, Mudit interjected

>*"guys, it will not be cool, I am not even kidding."* (L. 30)

Mudit explains further:

>*"obviously if three, four ppl won't go the others also won’t feel like going and nobody ends up going"* (L. 30)

Mudit's tone appears to be accusatory and hence to be taken seriously. Utkarsh and Priyanka appear to defend themselves and employ English to do so. Utkarsh argues:

>*"the thing is, you really can't convince me because ..."* (L. 32)

To which Mudit replies:

>*"I'm not convincing you, I'm just saying the situation ..."*  (L. 33)

And Priyanka says:

>*"I'm not saying I don't want to come, it's just —"* (L. 34)



This argument snippet is the most serious part of the conversation. Unlike the sections immediately before (L. 22 - 27) and after (L. 36 - 40), this section took place entirely in English. I believe this switch of languages is strategic to increase the gravity of the situation. To understand the significance of the code-switch, let me utilize Myers-Scotton's markedness model. Myers-Scotton proposes that in a conversation, speakers actively use an "unmarked" language to follow the social norm (a set of rights and obligations for the interlocutors) of the conversational context. By switching to another "marked" language, the speaker rejects the current norm by establishing a new norm between the interlocutors [@myers1995social].

Through the markedness model, I observe that by switching from Hindi to English, Mudit steers the conversation towards a more serious tone. Mudit asking a question in English also makes Priyanka and Utkarsh more alert. They both defend Mudit's accusations in English, thus, evidencing the somewhat obligatory norm of using English in the serious situation Mudit has set. While the content of Mudit's statement is serious too, expressing it in English appears more impactful in eliciting a serious response from the other interlocutors.

## Use of Hindi for casual conversations and setting a lighter mood

In contrast to using English, it appears that Hindi is used in nonargumentative situations. It's used more in conversations especially when casually taking about friends. Take for example a snippet (lines 13 - 19) where three of the interlocutors are discussing their own plans for Saturday morning entirely in Hindi. Gulati casually says:

>**"main raat ko aunga, shisha karunga aur chala jaunga"** (L. 14)

>*TL: I’ll arrive at night, smoke and then leave*

Further evidence of a casual conversation is seen when the three gossip about Ujjwal's (another absent friend) attendance in lines 50 - 52. In this snippet, the three interlocutors each recount a different statement that Ujjwal spoke to them in Hindi. Gulati says in Hindi that Ujjwal told him he's busy. While Mudit says Ujjwal is, in fact, available on Saturday.

In the above two snippets, Hindi is spoken in a very casual and relaxed manner, starkly in contrast to the way English was spoken. Using the markedness model, I observe that the social norm in a Hindi conversation is thus less serious and more light-hearted. I observe that the interlocutors switch to Hindi, immediately after the argumentation in English. Hindi seems to evoke a more casual atmosphere and soften the mood following an intense discussion on people's absence to Saturday's party. By switching the language, the interlocutors actively change the social norm of the conversation from a serious to a light-hearted one.

The social norms of the two languages -- English for expressing a serious idea while Hindi for lighthearted conversations can perhaps be better explained by their language ideologies present in the interlocutors.

The interlocutors employ only English in their academic and professional life while often reserving Hindi for mostly social and informal occasions such as conversations about friends. It's then likely that the interlocutors naturally tend to prefer a serious conversation taking place in English, more in line with their professional use of it. And in contrast, they reserve using Hindi for gossiping and casual conversations.

## Code-switching to effectively imitate and get into character

In addition to code-switching for altering the social norm and mood of the conversations as I discussed above, it can also be effective in conveying a unique experience. Let me elucidate with an example:

When my friends are discussing Anekant's (another absent friend) birthday party, they converse in Hindi (lines 59 - 72). During this conversation, my friends discuss whether they will be drinking at Anekant's party. To which Gulati adds:

>"**bhai peelenge, waise hi interesting ho ga**" (L. 66)

>*TL: Bro, we will drink. Then, it will be interesting*

Mudit then replies:

>"*Shots guys*" (voicing the valley girl) (L. 66)

Utkarsh then voices Priyanka:

>"**room me jayegi, aur bolegi,** 'let’s do shots guys, let’s go bananas'" (voicing the valley girl) (L. 70)

>*TL: She [Priyanka] will enter a room and say “Let’s do shots guys, let’s go bananas” (voicing the valley girl)*

When Mudit and Utkarsh both voice the valley girl -- an iconic party girl in southern California [@blyth1990m], they decide to voice her in English despite the entire conversation taking place in Hindi. When Utkarsh voices Priyanka, he's voicing Priyanka in valley-speak to say *"let's do shots, let's go bananas"*.

The content of the words *"let's do shots"* describes an intense partying attitude. But more than the words, I believe, code-switching to valley-speak amplifies this attitude in Mudit and Priyanka. Despite both Mudit and Priyanka, not partying much, speaking in valley-speak allows both Mudit and Priyanka to effectively convey a partying attitude in themselves. This is perhaps because valley-speak reminds the listeners of the valley girl's partying attitude. It's hard to think of any other Indian character, much less of one that speaks Hindi, that can evoke the same kind of partying attitude as the valley girl. Code-switching to an English and more precisely a particular register of it allows the interlocutors a way to imbue character traits of others (a valley girl) onto themselves more effectively than just words alone.

## Conclusion

By analyzing three different conversation snippets above, code-switching among my Hindi-English bilingual friends appears to be highly meaningful and strategic at times. I observed that English is used more during serious conversations when attempting to understand someone's motivations. In contrast, most casual and light-hearted conversations take place in Hindi. It may be interesting to note here that the evidence I analyzed was limited to exclusively Hindi or English sentences. Exploring more data and further analyzing code-switches within a sentence (1/4 of the sentences are in a mix) may reveal more nuanced information on the social norms of each of the languages in isolation as well as their blend.
