One of the most investigated questions of the 20th century has been the language-cognition hypothesis. Also known as the Whorfian hypothesis, it claims that a language may influence the way its users "conceive reality" [@whorf1956language]. Research in this field has been split into various groups. At one end, there exist researchers who deny the hypothesis while espousing that fundamental commonalities exist among all cultures. And, at the other end, researchers claim that language partially if not wholly determines its users' cognition [@roberson2005color].

There has been much research that investigates the validity of the Whorfian hypothesis in many branches of cognition - number systems [@gumperz1991rethinking], material and shape classification [@lucy1992language], time [@boroditsky2001does] etc. This paper, will, however, shed light on another cognitive process - color perception. This paper will first explain the significance of color perception to understanding the effect of language on cognition. Secondly and lastly, the paper will summarize some of the important and controversial research surrounding the linguistic relativist arguments in color perception.

Firstly, we ask ourselves why the linguistic examination of color perception is significant to the study of human cognition. Wierzbicka gives us many examples of how basic color terminology is different even in prominent European cultures. Commonly used Hungarian words *voros* and *piros* differentiate between types of red, while commonly used Russian words *goluboj* and *sinij* differentiate types of blue. The Polish words *niebieski* and *granatowy* also differentiate types of blue, but different from the Russian ones [@wierzbicka1990meaning]. Languages may have the ability to encode a vast number of colors. However, language usage emphasizes a core color vocabulary that is more commonly used. Because there are differences in basic colors in these cultures, we wonder if certain cultures have a specific way of perceiving objects and reality. It is interesting to study these differences and ask if these cultures differentiate between basic colors for their habitual actions in the context of their environment [@heider1972universals]. Or do all cultures universally differentiate colors in a fundamentally similar way due to biological reasons as Ozgen described in the study of 4-month-old babies differentiating colors [@ozgen2004language].

Studying color perception may also help us understand the link between language use and cognitive influence (especially memory and communication accuracy). Studies suggest that greater expertise in linguistically encoding colors is correlated with greater memory recall [@brown1954study]. Other studies show that communication accuracy i.e. the ability for a listener to recognize the object the speaker describes is highly correlated with the ability to recall information. [@lantz1964language]. Lantz and Stefflre showed that recognition and memory were positively correlated with greater color perception. Thereby hinting that communication accuracy could possibly be influenced by the extent to which color is linguistically encoded.

Color perception is also important in the study of language-cognition because of arbitrary color categories. Physically, color is believed to be a continuous and variable property (i.e. in terms of the wavelength of light or degree of brightness). However, common usage of color in the linguistic sense usually finds that color is often divided into distinct arbitrary categories such as red, blue, green in English [@heider1972structure]. This artificial and purposeful segmentation of a continuous physical quantity is interesting because codifying and categorizing the continuous visible color spectrum signals a possible cultural invention. Examples include languages that have been reported to use as few as two terms to describe all visible colors [@heider1972universals]. Others have been reported to use between three and eleven [@berlin1969basic]. While some others  (e.g., Russian) may have twelve [@davies1997cross].

Let us conclude this first segment of the essay by quickly summarizing why the study of color perception is linguistically interesting. Color perception is interesting because of:

a) its variety in cultures
b) its link to cognitive abilities such as memory and communication accuracy
c) it appears as arbitrary categories and therefore a culture invention.

Let us now proceed by looking at some of the significant linguistic relativity arguments made in this field.

We begin by first examining Berlin and Kay's 1969 paper *Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution*. One of the seminal work in the universalist arguments in color perception, their paper espouses that all cultures have 11 basic color categories. A language picks a subset of these 11 categories to encode basic color words that are used then consistently by those language speakers with high consensus [@berlin1969basic]. Their claim was supported by a study of 20 languages. Their hypothesis has gained significant support over the years by other universalist researchers. For example, three years later Heider in 1972 showed that recall abilities of the Papa New Guinea language Dani speakers and English speakers were higher for Berlin and Kay's basic colors than that of other secondary colors [@heider1972universals]. Hence, bolstering support for the existence of universal features [@deshpandecolor].

Berlin and Kay's hypothesis is not without contention, however. Understanding some of the contentions will shed light on the arguments made by relativist researchers. Notable concerns include that Berlin and Kay's language sample was not linguistically representative. 17 out of the 20 languages studied belonged to industrialized societies and were written languages [@kay2003resolving]. The similarities Berlin and Kay found could be attributed to the process of industrialization (a cultural effect) more than a universal biological feature [@hickerson1971review]. Thus, calling into question the universality of basic color terms.

Critics also brought into light examples of other languages especially those used by non-industrialized societies where Berlin and Kay's basic color terms are not visible. Examples include languages that do not encode blue and green into different terms [@kay1999color]. In addition, a study of Russian color naming by Davies and Corbett in 1994 demonstrated the existence of 12 color terms that satisfy Berlin and Kayâ€™s criteria for basicness [@davies1994basic]. Further studies on groups of English speakers and speakers of Berinmo (i.e., another language of Papua New Guinea with a vocabulary of only 5 basic color terms), found no evidence of higher memory accuracy for basic English colors in Berinmo speakers [@roberson2000color]. In fact, their study showed Berinmo speakers had higher recall in Berinmo basic color categories and poorer recall in English color categories. Interestingly, English speakers showed the reverse (higher recall in English color terms and poorer recall in Berinmo color terms). Thereby raising a counter-example to Heider's universalist claims that basic color terms influence greater memory recall.

Further examples note that the Hanunoo people use a four-way color categorization black, white, red, green. Hanunoo first emphasize contrast (differentiation between black/dark and white/light), then differentiate between "dryness" (red) and "freshness" (green) [@conklin1955hanunoo]. Such emphasis on "dryness/freshness" does not appear in Berlin and Kay's basic color terms. Lucy in 1997 claimed that restricting color perception study to color categorization studies using a fixed color palette (e.g. the Mussel Array color pallette used by Berlin and Kay only accounts for three parameters - hue, value, and chroma) is flawed. This is because Conklin's Hanunoo finding would not have been possible because studies that attempt to understand color categorization in a universal way would structurally disallow for the possibility to discover a new color system for e.g. one that the Hanunoo have [@lucy1997].


Having looked at both universalist and relativist arguments, it appears that the Whorfian question still remains elusive. While there appears to be some universal ability to differentiate colors (e.g. studies in 4-month-old babies by Ozgen 2004), the possible effect of cultural forces such as industrialization on color perception cannot be ignored. Despite similarities and differences, however, it remains unclear whether such differences signal to a different way of conceptualizing reality.

# Addendum: Possible implications on bilinguals

Literature suggests that it is highly contended whether bilinguals "code-switch" between different color perception systems in their different languages, or whether there is a "drift or transfer of color concepts" among their languages [@alvarado2002use].

Some studies suggest that Vietnamese-English bilinguals, use the vastly larger color lexicon in English to distinguish between colors when using Vietnamese [@jameson2003differences]. Other comparative studies conducted on Japanese speaking children (in Japan and in Germany) showed that western influence on children resulted in them using "non-basic" colors like brown, organic and pink with "borrowed western terms" [@zollinger1988categorical]. These two studies suggest that these bilinguals adapt to using a language with a larger color vocabulary in their other language usage as well.

To bring another perspective, let me use an anecdotal evidence, I find that as a Hindi-English bilingual, I approach color categorization differently than the Vietnamese-English and Japanese speakers described above. In Hindi, I describe colors using everyday references such as *rose* colored to describe pink, or *eggplant* colored to describe purple. In English, however, I resort to using already codified color words. I find that despite being more fluent in English, I do not attempt to find equivalent phrases to describe more precise colors when code-switching to Hindi. My behavior is in contrast to the studies on Vietnamese-English and Japanese bilinguals suggest. The contrast is that fluency in a language with a richer color vocabulary (English or German) may not influence the color system utilized in a bilingual's use of the other language (Vietnamese, Japanese or Hindi).

The above examples are not statistically significant, as most of these look at the influence of western languages with highly industrialized cultures. However, the examples show both possibilities. That, it is possible 1) for dominant languages to influence color perception in the other language and 2) to have isolated color perception systems despite one language being disproportionately dominant.
